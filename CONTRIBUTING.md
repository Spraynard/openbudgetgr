# Open Budget: Grand Rapids Contribution Guide

This document supplies extra information and procedures regarding contributing to Open Budget Grand Rapids.

## Getting Started Contributing

The easiest way you can make a pull request is by updating the project documentation. Otherwise you should check out the [issues](https://github.com/citizenlabsgr/openbudgetgr/issues) and see if there are any that you would like to work on.

If you want to develop on the project's main repository you **must create a development branch**.

For example, if you were working on a feature to classify different budget item types you might name your development branch something like `feature/budget-type-classifications`.

Anything as long as you are **not** developing directly on the `master` branch.

If you fork Open Budget Grand Rapids and develop on your own project you do not have to do this.
